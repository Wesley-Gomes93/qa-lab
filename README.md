**Full-stack QA lab with dual E2E (Cypress + Playwright), contract testing, performance suite, and LLM-powered test generation.**

---

## Problem → Solution → Result

**Problem:** QA automation is hard to scale — manual tests, scattered tools, and no clear pipeline to catch bugs before merge.

**Solution:** A full-stack testing lab where automation, AI agents, and CI/CD work together. Every PR triggers a pipeline; every failure blocks the merge.

**Result:** Automated quality gates, fast feedback (~5 min), unified reports, and AI-assisted test generation. The merge only goes through when everything passes.

## What I Learned

- **Dual E2E stack** — Running Cypress and Playwright in parallel taught me to design tests that can run on both; centralized specs for API tests reduced duplication.
- **Contract testing** — OpenAPI schema validation catches breaking changes before they reach E2E; a small investment with high ROI.
- **MCP and agents** — Integrating LLM-powered test generation (Groq, Gemini, OpenAI) showed how AI can extend QA workflows without replacing critical thinking.
- **Pipeline design** — Lint → Build → Tests (parallel) → Report creates fast feedback; blocking merge on failure enforces quality at the gate.
- **Performance as a test** — TICTAC metrics (load, health, TTI) turned performance from "nice to have" into an assertable requirement.

## Architecture decisions

**Why Cypress + Playwright?** Both frameworks run the same scenarios. I kept both to compare APIs, reports, and maintenance overhead. Playwright tends to run ~3x faster in CI; Cypress has a larger ecosystem. The decision was data-driven, not tool-centric.

**Why AI agents?** The Test Writer and Failure Analyzer extend QA without replacing critical thinking. They show how LLM integration fits into real workflows — generating specs from descriptions and suggesting fixes when tests fail.

**Why contract testing?** OpenAPI validation catches breaking API changes before E2E. A small upfront investment (schema + validator script) prevents subtle bugs from reaching UI tests.

**Trade-offs:** I chose not to add full AWS infra (ECS, ALB, CDN) — the ROI for a QA portfolio is low compared to polish and documentation. I also deferred Slack/Teams notifications and historical dashboards; they add value in production, less so for portfolio presentation.

## Tech Highlights

| Area | What's in place |
|------|-----------------|
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Lint → Build → Tests (Cypress \|\| Playwright) → Unified Report. Merge blocked if any step fails. |
| **Dual E2E Stack** | Cypress + Playwright run in parallel. Centralized specs for API tests (one source, two runners). |
| **Contract Testing** | OpenAPI 3.0 spec validation. Schema checks before deploy. |
| **Performance Testing** | TICTAC suite: load, health, TTI, dashboard critical path latency. |
| **AI Agents** | 3 agents: MCP menu (interactive test runs), Test Writer (LLM-powered — Groq, Gemini, OpenAI), Failure Analyzer (auto-diagnose and suggest fixes). |
| **Reports** | Mochawesome (Cypress), Playwright HTML, unified QA Lab report. |

## Architecture

| Layer | Tech | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Frontend | Next.js | Playground (auth) + Admin dashboard (CRUD users) |
| Backend | Node.js + Express | REST API: auth, users, healthcheck |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Docker; seed with admin user |
| Tests | Cypress + Playwright | E2E suites: api, auth, admin, ui, performance |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | pipeline.yml, agent.yml |
| Agents | MCP, Node.js | Menu, Test Writer (LLM), Failure Analyzer |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
cd backend && npm install && cd ..
cd tests && npm install && cd ..

# 2. Start environment (DB, backend, frontend)
npm run dev

# 3. Run tests
npm run tests:run
```

---

## Key Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start DB, backend, frontend (dynamic: only starts what's not running) |
| `npm run tests:run` | Cypress E2E |
| `npm run tests:pw` | Playwright E2E |
| `npm run tests:report:unified` | Unified HTML report (Cypress + Playwright) |
| `npm run tests:contract` | Contract testing against OpenAPI spec |
| `npm run agent:run-tests` | Interactive menu to run Cypress via MCP |
| `npm run agent:test-writer "description"` | **Generate tests with LLM** (Groq, Gemini, OpenAI) |
| `npm run agent:analyze-failures` | Run tests; on failure, analyze and suggest fixes |

---

## Test Writer Agent

Generate Cypress and/or Playwright tests from natural language. **API key required** in `.env` (Groq or Gemini are free).

```bash
npm run agent:test-writer "API healthcheck"
npm run agent:test-writer "POST /auth/register returns 201"
npm run agent:test-writer -- --framework both "login flow"  # Cypress + Playwright
```

**Suites:** `api` | `auth` | `admin` | `dashboard` | `ui` | `performance`
